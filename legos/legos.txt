Code in the /legos dir tends to be solutions or parts of solutions
from common interview or coding test problems. Like a lego set,
in this directory expect to find many kinds of parts of coding solutions,
algorithms and design patterns put together in a variety of ways.
Many of these examples come from real employment technical assessments and
technical job interviews for Software Engineering positions.
Particularly common or difficult items will be emphasized with a mixture of
both basic and advanced topics.
