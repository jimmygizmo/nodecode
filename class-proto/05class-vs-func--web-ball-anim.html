<!-- At the bottom of the StackEx thread is a working version, which this code now is. -->
<!-- Just something found on StackExchange that was showing simply how the function keyword is not used in front of
method definitions. -->
<!-- I wanted to get it working and there are no bugs I can see, but there is no ball animated or shown on the page. -->
