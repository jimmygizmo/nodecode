Function expressions and the arrow syntax:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function

A function expression is similar to and has the same syntax as a function declaration.
I think of function expressions as being on the right side of an equals sign
  or as an argument or parameter to something. It is not allowed at the start of a statement.

const getRectArea = function(width, height) {
  return width * height;
};

console.log(getRectArea(3, 4));
// expected output: 12
